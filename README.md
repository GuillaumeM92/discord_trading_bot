# Discord 'Trading Bot'

With this bot, you can use the $ sign followed by a ticker to get the latest stock daily close price, fetched from the Polygon API.   

For example type: `$AAPL` in any text channel and the bot will respond.   

Use this URL to invite the bot: https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=1195365703813976114&permissions=2048&scope=bot

**NOTE:** Using the free tier for the polygon api, we can't get the latest ticker price, so we used the last daily close instead.
